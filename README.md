# cmpt318-project

This application is written in R. This R program takes a large data set (years) of power consumption in an area and analyzes for any anomilies
within the time period specified. 

It is able to find complex anomalies as well as point anomalies and graph them (coloured) in order for better visibilty. It will summerize 
the results into time fames of Weekends/weekdays and all 4 seasons through out a year. 

Seasons are seperated into 2 (Winter and Fall / Summer and Spring) Spring and Fall dont have enough significant of an impact for them 
to be alone, so the seasons were combined.

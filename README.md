# cmpt318-project

This R program takes a large data set (years) of power consumption in an area and analyzes for any anomalies within the time period specified. 

The program can detect complex and point anomalies in data sets and display them on a coloured graph. The results are separated into time frames of weekends and weekdays from each season of the year. 

Seasons are seperated into 2 categories (Winter and Fall / Summer and Spring). The power consumption in Spring and Fall are quite similar to Summer and Winter, so the seasons were combined.
